  > My name is Alex Joshua Espinoza, and as of January 25th, I am 18 years old. I've had a childhood alot of people would consider unique, one distant from the influences of social media or modernized technology. It was never a farm, but it wasn't anything fancy either. Because of this, I've grown to enjoy the little things in life and live in the moment, so I don't take photos all that often. Spending a decent amount of my life in solitude, I've grown accustomed to old computers and consoles like the Playstation 2, both of which were major factors as to why I chose this field in the first place. I aspire to be like the ones that first made me happy in those moments, which is why I've tried my hand at game development in the Unity Engine, as well as learning how to put computers together using as little parts as I could find.</p>

<p>I've developed a unique love for games like Star wars: Legion and Warhammer 40k, because they always put my brain to think in unique ways I never thought possible for myself. Strategy games and Survival horror games in general are what appeal to me the most, and I always find enjoyment in the thrill of resource management.</p>

<p> I  enjoy a good strategy game, but I also love a good narrative-focused game, or even book. Very few books and genres satiate my palette for a narrative-based experience, as I'm not a fan of visual novels or reading something that doesn't particularly interest me often. But when I'm invested in a certain book or game's story, I tend to spend a never-ending amount of hours finding every ounce of detail on the world-building I can get. It's this constant flow of amazing writing and love for reading that inspired me to write for my own. I'd grown to love classes involving english and writing, since I thrived so easily in them. I loved them so much that I pretty much knocked down as many literature-like courses as I could here. Here are some of my favorite books, as well as my favorite Narrative-based game:</p>

<p> A few people know this, but I grew up watching alot of cowboy stuff. I spent most of my life watching old school Spaghetti Westerns, with characters like The Man with No Name and Django sorta shaping me into the person I am now. Old west films mean alot to me, so much so that I honestly don't have a favorite, I love them all equally. I'd watch them in the form of burned CD's in my old Playstation 2, but I'd also watch alot of 90s and early 2000s anime like Sailor Moon and Cowboy Bebop on tv or on VHS at my grandma's when I was given the chance to visit her. I remember each film and its plot fondly, with my personal favorite being either "Django" or "The good, The bad, and the Ugly". </p>
